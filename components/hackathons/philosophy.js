          <strong>The best way to learn is by building.</strong> A hackathon is
          a space that helps give makers everything they need to start
          buildingâ€“mentors, collaborators, inspiration, and a goal to work
          towards. Hackers will leave a hackathon with a project of their own,
          ready and excited to keep hacking once they get home.
